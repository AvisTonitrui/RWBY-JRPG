Backstory:
	Childhood -
		Leocadia is the unintended child of Custodia and Mal Prieto. Her father is the kingpin of the Vacuo underground, having built it from the foundations his father left him.
		Against Leocadia's kind-hearted mother's wishes, Mal put her to work at a young age. She was taught how to pickpocket and would run around in one of her father's establishments, robbing people blind.
		Though Custodia could do nothing to stop Mal, she taught Leocadia her ideals, which was to do what was necessary for there to be a right choice.
	
	Teenage Years - 
		As Leocadia grew, so did her role in her father's business. Seeing her natural athleticism, Mal appointed her to be a courier. Seeing her natural athleticism, Mal appointed her to be a courier.
		A courier's job was simple, carry messages and packages from point A to point B. The issue with this is that she would often have to dodge rival gangs and peacekeepers.
		Leocadia began to grow distant from her mother, but never forgot that what she was doing wasn't always right.

	Adulthood/Current -
		With the great war in full swing, Leocadia is kept busy facilitating the transport of dust to her father's customers.
		Her mother left them and moved to Vale, wanting to find someone who actively fought for their beliefs, not passively profit in conflict.
		This has rattled Leocadia and has left her wondering what to do to be more active in her life.

	How They Discovered Their Semblance -
		It was supposed to be a normal run, carrying some letters to one of her father's remote locations.
		And while there wasn't any sensitive information in them, the rival gang whose territory Leocadia was crossing assumed her father would never send her on such a mundane mission.
		Not fearing an attack, Leocadia chose to go by street instead of rooftop. However, once she was in the market, she realized she was being tailed. Trying to lose them, Leocadia ducked into into an alley.
		As soon as she was out of sight, she began to run, taking turns in as random a pattern as possible so as to throw off any pursuit. Looking behind her, she saw the gang members slowly closing in on her.
		Leocadia saw the marketplace again and decided to try and make a distraction to get away. As she came closer, the sun glaring down the street, she formulated a path to an alley across the way.
		Right as she thought of beginning her path, though, everything went dark for a brief moment. When the light came back, Leocadia found herself in the alley she was going to end up in.
		Unable to take the time to process what just happened, she quickly ducked further into the alley before she was seen and went on with her delivery.
