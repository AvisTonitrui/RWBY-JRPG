    - Began planning the way we will be rendering graphics onscreen and is detailed in screen.txt in the engine subdirectory of documentation
    - Began learning how to use Pygame to begin work on the game itself.
        - As of right now, I'm just learning the basics:
            - How to set up a screen
            - How to render images
            - How to move sprites onscreen
            - Using z-order
    - Began a skeleton program

    - Began working on the map parser and getting that squared away. I'm still deciding on how to do it, but for now, I think I've decided to use a map config file
        - Thinking about how to do any sort of rendering and how I will implement scrolling, but as of now, I need a sample tileset to test rendering in general with
    - Began finding out ways to handle keyboard inputs
