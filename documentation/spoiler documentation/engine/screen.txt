Screen dimensions: 1024x768

Tiles are 32x32
Sprites are 32x32 also

If we do scaling, I believe that only integer scaling would be best, although I could look into bilinear scaling.

The screen can be split into a grid of 32x24 tiles.

This is key to level design and therefore should be stated in the documentation for that later on.
