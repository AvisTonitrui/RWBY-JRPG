	- Please note that some things have occured prior to this journal's creation, and are therefore not mentioned in this log
	- If any other members on this project wish to create an entry, please note the format I have created and follow it, at least until your in your own personal entries, which it doesn't matter how you format those
	- Character Notes:
		- Have basic info on most of the PCs, need to concrete the senblance for Theia

		- Same for enemies
	- Plot Notes:
		- Have a very basic plot figured out right now, more details will need to be fleshed out
