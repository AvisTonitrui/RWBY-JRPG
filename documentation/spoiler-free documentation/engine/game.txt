The game could work as a state machine
    - The game has a set of states, and these states determine the way the game behaves
        -Example: The menu is state 0 and causes certain things to be loaded and unloaded, and main game can be state 1 and causes other things to be loaded etc.


Game state list:
    - 00: Title Screen
        - 01: Main menu
    - 10: Overworld
    - 20: Battle
    - 30: Ingame menu
