Thomas "T.J." Adams:
	- This is the beginning of the Dev Log, where everything that people want to add as updates may be added
	- I will personally be using this as much as I can to help organize my thoughts
	- Please note that some things have occured prior to this journal's creation, and are therefore not mentioned in this log
	- If any other members on this project wish to create an entry, please note the format I have created and follow it, at least until your in your own personal entries, which it doesn't matter how you format those
	- Character Notes:
		- Have basic info on most of the PCs, need to concrete the senblance for Theia
		- No NPC work is done yet, need to create a world first
		- Same for enemies
	- Plot Notes:
		- Have a very basic plot figured out right now, more details will need to be fleshed out
